# Documentation

This project led to the creation of 2 documents that describe in great detail the internal design of the Intel 4004 (see below). 

The *ref* folder is a collection of all the documentation gathered on the Internet that was used in the project.

The *images* folder contains the flowcharts used in the paper.

## [Inside the 4004](./Inside_the_Intel_4004.pdf)

This paper describes all the differents architectural block inside the 4004 at the register transfer level (RTL).

## [MCS-4: 4004 Detailed Timing](./MCS-4-4004-Detailed-Timing.pdf)

This large table shows exactly what is happening inside the CPU during each state of the instruction table. It is based on the same 
names and terminology used in the paper.
